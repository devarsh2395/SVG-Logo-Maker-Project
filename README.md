# SVG-Logo-Maker-Project
![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

This is a  command-line application for creating custom logos and saving them as SVG files. The user is prompted for input such as text, text color, shape, and shape color. The application includes classes for Triangle, Circle, and Square shapes, with a render method to return the corresponding SVG code. Input is collected using the Inquirer package and the generated SVG is saved as logo.svg. Unit tests for each shape class are included using Jest. Simply run node index.js to start creating your custom logos.
